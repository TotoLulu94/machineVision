This Repository regroups the course projects I had during the Machine Vision Course of my MSc


### Image Segmentation
Implementation of a segmentation algorithm training mixtures of Gaussians to detect apples in an image.
<\br>main.m shows an exemple about how to create a dataset, train a model and then plot the ROCCurve.
fitMixGauss.m contains all the subroutines to fit a mixture of Gaussians to a data set.
Homework.m regroupe all the following task : Create training, test and validation sets, trains several mixtures of Gaussians, compare their prediction to choose the best model, plot the ROC Curve, then run the chosen model on unseen data.
